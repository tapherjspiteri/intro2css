Box Model Notes
________________


1. Height and Width
- default width is inline elements is the content
- elements not inline can take width and height properties 

2. Border
- any element can have a border around it
- border property specifies style, width and color

how do the elements fit on the screen. 
- borders can be set and removed later - setting them let you see how much space they take


border-style none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, grove, ridge, inset, outset, hidden



default color - black, 1 px


width - px, thin, medium or large

color - can be set or left alone for transparent.


div {
	border: solid 1 px #CC00AA;
}


border-width: 3 px - sets to 3px wide border.

border-width: top, right, bottom, left


margin - is the space outside of the border, between you and the next box.

positive margin - move element to right/down
negative margin - left, up

paddin - space between the element and the border
 - positive - moves outward from the element
  - only numerical value, will always be transparent

 Padding is the space between the text and the border.

 Margin is the space between elments.

 additive height and width: if you add 200 px, plus all the other aspects.  Margin + Border + padding + element = actual width of element.

 example:

 div {
     width: 100px;
     height: 50px;
     padding: 10px;
     margin: 5px;
     border: 1px solid black;
 }
weight = 100 + 5 +5 + 1 + 1  +10 +10

Height. = Top and bottom margin, Top and bottom padding, Top and bottom border
 TOTAL PIXELS = 

Centering elements on the page:

default:

margin: 0 auto;

- must be block
- must not float
mustnot have a fixed or absolute position
must have a width not set to auto


Box-sizing:

- takes some of the math out
- content-box: default additive
- border-box: width takes content,padding and border into consideration 

  options are: content-box (default additive), border-box (width takes content, padding and border into consideration : 200 pixels -border, padding) 

  Measurements:

  Absolute: set an element to a specific size

 Fluid: size is relative to surrounding elements, vw, vh, %, em and rem.
